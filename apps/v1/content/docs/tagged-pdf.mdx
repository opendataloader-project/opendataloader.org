## Why Tagged PDF Matters for AI

Tagged PDF includes semantic structure (headings, paragraphs, lists, tables) that tells AI exactly how a document is organized. When a PDF has proper tags, you get:

- **Exact layout intent** — No guessing, no heuristics
- **Correct reading order** — Author's intended flow preserved
- **Semantic hierarchy** — Headings, lists, tables properly identified

### European Accessibility Act (EAA)

The [European Accessibility Act](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/disability/union-equality-strategy-rights-persons-disabilities-2021-2030/european-accessibility-act_en) took effect **June 28, 2025**, requiring accessible digital documents across the EU. This means:

- More PDFs will be properly tagged with semantic structure
- Organizations must publish accessible documents
- Tagged PDF adoption is accelerating

**OpenDataLoader leverages this shift** — when structure tags exist, we extract the exact layout the author intended, without guessing.

## How to Use Tagged PDF

Enable Tagged PDF extraction with the `use_struct_tree` option:

```python
import opendataloader_pdf

opendataloader_pdf.convert(
    input_path="accessible-document.pdf",
    output_dir="output/",
    use_struct_tree=True  # Use native PDF structure tags
)
```

Most PDF parsers ignore structure tags entirely. OpenDataLoader is one of the few that fully supports them.

## Development Status

| Feature | Purpose | Status |
|:--------|:--------|:-------|
| Tag extraction | Use existing tags to determine document structure | Available |
| Tag validation | Validate tags against PDF Association recommendations | In progress |
| Hybrid extraction | Combine tags with visual heuristics for best results | In progress |

## Use Cases

### Research Papers
A well-tagged paper lets AI accurately identify author names, affiliations, and sections — enabling automated citation building.

### Financial Reports
Proper tags enable precise extraction of balance sheet titles and data cells, automating analysis without error-prone heuristics.

### Legal Contracts
Tags help AI quickly identify and cross-reference clauses, dates, and parties — speeding up legal review.
