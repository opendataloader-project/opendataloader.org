title: Reading Order & XY-Cut++

## The Multi-Column Problem

PDF files don't store text in reading order. They store drawing instructions — "draw this glyph at position (x, y)". When you have a two-column academic paper or a newspaper layout, naive text extraction reads left-to-right across the entire page, mixing content from different columns:

```
❌ Wrong extraction:
"Introduction    Methods
This paper...   We used..."

✅ Correct extraction:
"Introduction
This paper presents a novel approach...

Methods
We used the following methodology..."
```

This is one of the most common complaints about PDF parsers in RAG pipelines. Jumbled text destroys context and confuses LLMs.

## How XY-Cut++ Works

OpenDataLoader uses the **XY-Cut++** algorithm, an enhanced version of the classic XY-Cut recursive segmentation. It works in four phases:

### Phase 1: Cross-Layout Detection

First, we identify elements that span multiple columns — headers, footers, and full-width titles. These are extracted separately so they don't interfere with column detection.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│      DOCUMENT TITLE             │  ← Cross-layout (full width)
├───────────────┬─────────────────┤
│ Column 1      │ Column 2        │
│ text...       │ text...         │
│ text...       │ text...         │
├───────────────┴─────────────────┤
│      Page Footer                │  ← Cross-layout (full width)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 2: Density Analysis

We calculate the content density ratio to determine whether the layout is content-dense (like newspapers) or sparse:

- **High density (>0.9)**: Prefer horizontal cuts first
- **Low density**: Prefer vertical cuts first

This adaptive approach handles different document styles correctly.

### Phase 3: Recursive Segmentation

The algorithm recursively divides the page by finding the largest gaps:

1. Project all content onto the X-axis and Y-axis
2. Find the largest gap in each direction
3. Cut along the axis with the larger gap
4. Repeat recursively until regions contain single columns

```
Step 1: Find vertical gap → Split into left/right columns
Step 2: Within each column, find horizontal gaps → Split into blocks
Step 3: Order blocks top-to-bottom within each column
```

### Phase 4: Merge Cross-Layout Elements

Finally, cross-layout elements (headers, footers) are reinserted at the correct positions based on their Y-coordinates.

## Why This Matters for RAG

Correct reading order is essential for:

- **Chunking**: Semantic chunks should contain coherent text, not mixed columns
- **Context windows**: LLMs need text in the order humans would read it
- **Citations**: Bounding boxes are only useful if the text they reference is correct

## Usage

Enable XY-Cut++ reading order in your conversion:

```python
import opendataloader_pdf

opendataloader_pdf.convert(
    input_path="two-column-paper.pdf",
    output_dir="output/",
    format="markdown,json",
    reading_order="xycut"  # Enable XY-Cut++
)
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
opendataloader-pdf --reading-order xycut input.pdf
```

## Comparison with Other Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Raw extraction** | Fast | Wrong order, unusable for RAG |
| **ML-based** | Can learn complex layouts | GPU required, variable output |
| **XY-Cut++** (OpenDataLoader) | Deterministic, fast, no GPU | May struggle with very irregular layouts |

## Technical Details

The algorithm is implemented in:
- `XYCutPlusPlusSorter.java` — Main algorithm
- `GapBasedSorter.java` — Gap detection utilities

Key parameters:
- **Beta threshold** (default: 2.0): Controls cross-layout element detection
- **Density threshold** (default: 0.9): Switches between horizontal/vertical preference
- **Minimum gap** (default: 5.0 points): Prevents splitting on insignificant gaps

## When to Use Reading Order

| Document Type | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| Single-column documents | Optional (already in order) |
| Academic papers (2-column) | **Strongly recommended** |
| Newspapers, magazines | **Strongly recommended** |
| Forms, tables | Usually not needed |
| Scanned documents | Combine with OCR (coming soon) |
