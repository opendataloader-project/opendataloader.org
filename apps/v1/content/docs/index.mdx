description: Safe, local-first PDF conversion for AI workflows
---

OpenDataLoader PDF converts PDFs into JSON, Markdown, HTML, or annotated PDFs that are ready for LLMs, vector search, and RAG pipelines. It reconstructs layout (tables, lists, headers, images, reading order) using a fast heuristic engine that runs entirely on your machine with AI-safety enabled by default.

## Preview

Download the [annotated PDF sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendataloader-project/opendataloader-pdf/main/resources/1901.03003_annotated.pdf) and compare it to the [source PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03003) to see how detected structures overlay on each page.
