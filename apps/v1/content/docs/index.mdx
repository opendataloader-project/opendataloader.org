description: Safe, local-first PDF conversion for AI workflows
---

OpenDataLoader PDF converts PDFs into JSON, Markdown, HTML, or annotated PDFs that are ready for LLMs, vector search, and RAG pipelines. It reconstructs layout (tables, lists, headers, images, reading order) using a fast heuristic engine that runs entirely on your machine with AI-safety enabled by default.

## Annotated PDF Visualizations

OpenDataLoader supports Annotated PDF visualization that highlights the actual layout structure extracted from the document.

Explore the [sample PDFs](/demo) to see it in action!
