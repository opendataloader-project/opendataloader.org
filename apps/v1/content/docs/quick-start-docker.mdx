title: Quick Start with Docker
description: Run OpenDataLoader PDF inside a container
---

Use the published container when you want an isolated runtime or do not want to manage Python/Node installations locally.

## Quick run

Download a sample PDF:

```bash
curl -L -o 1901.03003.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03003
```

Run the container to convert the PDF into Markdown, HTML, and an annotated PDF:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work \
  ghcr.io/opendataloader-project/opendataloader-pdf-cli:latest \
  /work/1901.03003.pdf --markdown --html --pdf
```

- Mount the working directory so that outputs are written back to the host.
- Pass any CLI flags after the input paths (`--format`, `--content-safety-off`, etc.).

## Image details

- Registry: `ghcr.io/opendataloader-project/opendataloader-pdf-cli`
- Tags follow the CLI release cycle; `latest` tracks the most recent tag.
- Java 11+ is already bundled inside the container.

For long-running jobs, mount a dedicated output directory and consider using bind mounts for input corpora to avoid copying data into the container each time.
