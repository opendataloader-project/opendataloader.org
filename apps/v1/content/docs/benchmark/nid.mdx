title: Reading Order (NID)
description: Measures whether text is extracted in the correct sequence

## Why Reading Order Matters for RAG

When a PDF has multiple columns, sidebars, or complex layouts, many parsers read text left-to-right across the entire page — mixing content from different sections. This creates incoherent chunks that confuse LLMs and produce wrong answers.

**Example problem:** A two-column academic paper where the parser jumps between columns mid-sentence, making the extracted text unreadable.

## What NID Measures

NID (Normalized Indel Distance) compares the extracted text against human-verified ground truth. A score of 1.0 means perfect order; lower scores indicate text was scrambled or misplaced.

## Results

| Engine         | Score | Rank |
|----------------|-------|------|
| OpenDataLoader | 0.91  | #1   |
| Docling        | 0.90  | #2   |
| PyMuPDF4LLM    | 0.89  | #3   |
| MarkItDown     | 0.88  | #4   |

- All engines score 0.88+ — basic reading order is a solved problem for simple documents
- Gaps appear in complex layouts — multi-column, mixed text/table, and nested sections reveal differences

## When to Prioritize This Metric

| Use Case                           | Recommended Engine   |
|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Multi-column layouts               | **OpenDataLoader**   |
| Academic papers, reports           | **OpenDataLoader**   |
| Simple single-column documents     | Any engine works     |
