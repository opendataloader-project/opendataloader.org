[OpenDataLoader Benchmark](https://github.com/opendataloader-project/opendataloader-bench) compares engines using a shared corpus and harmonised evaluation pipeline. It normalises predictions into Markdown, compares them against curated ground-truth annotations, and reports quality metrics for reading order, table fidelity, and heading hierarchy. The tooling is modular so new engines, corpora, or scoring routines can be slotted in with minimal effort.

## How to read the metrics

- **OVERALL QUALITY**: Average of `Reading Order (NID)`, `Table Structure (TEDS)`, and `Heading Levels (MHS)`. This is the default quality view.
- **ENERGY**: Total energy consumption from `powermetrics`. It is the primary operating KPI for cost, battery, and carbon impact.
- **TIME**: Average document processing time. It is a secondary KPI for latency-sensitive workloads.
