## About the Benchmark Project

PDF documents are everywhere, but LLMs can't read them directly. Converting PDFs to Markdown preserves structure (headings, tables, reading order) that helps LLMs understand and answer questions accurately.

This benchmark compares open-source PDF-to-Markdown engines to help you choose the right tool for your RAG pipeline or document processing workflow.

**What we measure:**

- **Reading Order** — Is the text extracted in the correct sequence?
- **Table Fidelity** — Are tables accurately reconstructed?
- **Heading Hierarchy** — Is the document structure preserved?

The evaluation pipeline is modular—add new engines, corpora, or metrics with minimal effort.
