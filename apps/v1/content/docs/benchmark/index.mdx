## About the Benchmark Project

PDF documents are everywhere, but LLMs can't read them directly. Converting PDFs to Markdown preserves structure (headings, tables, reading order) that helps LLMs understand and answer questions accurately.

This benchmark compares open-source PDF-to-Markdown engines to help you choose the right tool for your RAG pipeline or document processing workflow.

**What we measure:**

- **Reading Order** — Is the text extracted in the correct sequence?
- **Table Fidelity** — Are tables accurately reconstructed?
- **Heading Hierarchy** — Is the document structure preserved?

The evaluation pipeline is modular—add new engines, corpora, or metrics with minimal effort.

### Quick Comparison

| Engine             | Speed (s/page) | Reading Order | Table    | Heading  |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **opendataloader** | **0.05**       | **0.91**      | 0.49     | 0.65     |
| docling            | 0.73           | 0.90          | **0.89** | **0.80** |
| pymupdf4llm        | 0.09           | 0.89          | 0.40     | 0.41     |
| markitdown         | **0.04**       | 0.88          | 0.00     | 0.00     |

> Scores are normalized to [0, 1]. Higher is better for accuracy metrics; lower is better for speed. **Bold** indicates best performance.

## When to Use Each Engine

| Use Case                 | Recommended Engine | Why                                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Best overall balance     | **opendataloader** | Fast with high reading order accuracy     |
| Maximum accuracy         | docling            | Highest scores for tables and headings, but 16x slower |
| Speed-critical pipelines | markitdown         | Fastest, but no table/heading extraction               |
| PyMuPDF ecosystem        | pymupdf4llm        | Good balance if already using PyMuPDF                  |
