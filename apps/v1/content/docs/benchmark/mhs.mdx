title: Heading Levels (MHS)
description: Measures whether document structure is preserved

## Why Heading Structure Matters for RAG

Headings define document hierarchy — chapters, sections, subsections. RAG systems use this structure to create meaningful chunks and understand context. If headings are missed or mis-leveled, chunks lose their semantic boundaries.

**Example problem:** A user asks about "Section 3.2" but the parser didn't detect it as a heading, so the RAG system can't locate that section.

## What MHS Measures

MHS (Markdown Heading Similarity) compares detected headings and their levels against ground truth. A score of 1.0 means all headings were correctly identified with proper hierarchy; lower scores indicate missed or incorrectly leveled headings.

## Results

| Engine         | Score | Rank |
|----------------|-------|------|
| Docling        | 0.80  | #1   |
| OpenDataLoader | 0.65  | #2   |
| PyMuPDF4LLM    | 0.41  | #3   |
| MarkItDown     | 0.00  | #4   |

- ML-based engines (Docling) outperform rule-based engines for heading detection
- MarkItDown doesn't extract heading levels at all

## When to Prioritize This Metric

| Use Case                              | Recommended Engine   |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Long documents with deep hierarchy    | **Docling**          |
| Legal documents, technical manuals    | **Docling**          |
| Semantic chunking by section          | Docling or OpenDataLoader |
| Simple documents, flat structure      | Any engine works     |

## Trade-offs

Higher heading accuracy comes with slower processing. Docling scores 0.80 but takes 16x longer than OpenDataLoader. If your documents have simple structure, speed may matter more.
