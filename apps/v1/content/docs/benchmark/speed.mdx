title: Extraction Speed
description: Measures processing speed per document
---

## Why Speed Matters

Processing time directly impacts cost and user experience. A 10x slower parser means 10x more compute cost at scale — or unacceptable wait times for interactive applications.

## What We Measure

Average seconds per page across the benchmark corpus, covering the full pipeline: PDF parsing, layout analysis, and Markdown generation.

## Results

| Engine         | Speed (s/page) | Rank | Notes                          |
|----------------|----------------|------|--------------------------------|
| MarkItDown     | 0.04           | #1   | No table/heading extraction    |
| OpenDataLoader | 0.05           | #1   | Best speed/accuracy balance    |
| PyMuPDF4LLM    | 0.09           | #2   | Moderate speed                 |
| Docling        | 0.73           | #4   | 16x slower, highest accuracy   |

## When to Prioritize Speed

| Use Case                           | Recommended Engine   |
|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Batch processing (1000s of docs)   | **OpenDataLoader**   |
| Real-time / interactive apps       | **OpenDataLoader** or MarkItDown |
| Cost-sensitive deployments         | **OpenDataLoader**   |
| Accuracy-critical, time flexible   | Docling              |

## Notes

- Measurements are single-threaded on CPU
- Multi-threading and GPU acceleration can change rankings
- All engines run locally — no network latency
