title: Extraction Time
description: End-to-end document processing latency per engine
---

Extraction time is the average per-document runtime on the shared corpus, covering the full pipeline (page parsing → layout reconstruction → Markdown generation).

## Notes

- Pair with `energy` for latency-sensitive workloads to see if fast engines also stay power-efficient.
- Values are single-thread measurements; rankings can shift with multi-threaded or accelerator-enabled runs.
