description: Build and run OpenDataLoader PDF from source
---

The repository ships a Maven-based build that produces the CLI and core libraries. Use it when you need to test local changes or contribute fixes.

## Build the project

```bash
mvn clean install -f java/pom.xml
```

Successful builds produce artifacts under `java/opendataloader-pdf-cli/target`, including the shaded CLI JAR.

## Run the CLI from source

```bash
java -jar opendataloader-pdf-cli-<VERSION>.jar [options] <INPUT FILE OR FOLDER>
```

Refer to the [CLI usage](/docs/quick-start-java#cli-usage) for the full flag list.

## Javadoc

Refer to the [Javadoc documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.opendataloader/opendataloader-pdf-core/latest) for the full API reference.
