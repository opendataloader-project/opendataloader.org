# OpenDataLoader.org

This repository hosts the public website and documentation for OpenDataLoader. It is a Turborepo workspace whose only app today is `apps/v1`, a Next.js 16 site that renders marketing pages plus the Fumadocs-powered docs experience under `/docs`.

## What lives where

| Path                                | Purpose                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/v1/src/app`                   | Next.js App Router routes such as `/`, `/contact`, `/docs`, `/showcase`, API routes, and global layout assets. |
| `apps/v1/content/docs`              | Source-of-truth MDX pages that Fumadocs ingests. Each file maps directly to `/docs/:slug`.                     |
| `apps/v1/public`                    | Static assets. Use `public/figures` for images referenced inside docs.                                         |
| `apps/v1/source.config.ts`          | Fumadocs `defineDocs` config that points at `content/docs`.                                                    |
| `turbo.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Workspace orchestration for builds, linting, and dependency sharing.                                           |

## Developer onboarding (core engineers)

- **Prerequisites**
  - Node.js ≥ 18 (match `.nvmrc` if present) and `pnpm@9` (`corepack enable pnpm` keeps versions consistent).
  - Optional: `turbo` installed globally for faster local runs (`pnpm add -g turbo`).
- **Install once**
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```
- **Daily commands**
  - `pnpm dev --filter v1` — runs the Next.js dev server with the docs, marketing pages, and API routes.
  - `pnpm build --filter v1` — production build. CI runs `pnpm build` from the repo root which fans out via Turborepo.
  - `pnpm lint --filter v1` and `pnpm format` — keep ESLint + Prettier happy before opening PRs.
- **Environment variables**
  - Only one secret is required locally today: `RESEND_API_KEY` for the `/api/contact` route (`apps/v1/src/app/api/contact/route.ts`). Without it, contact form submissions will fail; guard the UI or disable the route while developing if you do not have a key.
  - Add any new secrets to `.env.local` and document them in this README under this section.
- **Testing checklist before opening a PR**
  - Run `pnpm dev --filter v1` and exercise the pages you touched, especially `/docs`, `/contact`, and `/showcase`.
  - Run `pnpm lint --filter v1`.
  - If you changed MDX or assets, confirm images resolve from `apps/v1/public`.

## Fumadocs authoring (non‑developer managers)

You only need basic Markdown knowledge to keep docs up to date. Everything lives under `apps/v1/content/docs`.

- **Add or edit a page**
  1. Duplicate an existing file (for example `apps/v1/content/docs/quick-start-python.mdx`) and rename it with a URL-friendly slug (e.g., `pricing.mdx` → `/docs/pricing`).
  2. Update the frontmatter block at the top:
     ```mdx
     ---
     title: Short headline shown in the sidebar
     description: One sentence summary used in SEO and cards
     ---
     ```
  3. Write content in Markdown. MDX lets you embed React components such as `<Cards>` or `<Callout>` if needed; existing examples in the folder provide copy‑and‑paste starter blocks.
- **Keep the navigation in sync**
  - `apps/v1/content/docs/meta.json` controls sidebar groupings. Add the new slug (without `.mdx`) in the right section. Lines starting with `---Heading---` are visual dividers, not pages.
  - The order of entries in `meta.json` is the order shown in the sidebar.
- **Reuse assets**
  - Place screenshots or diagrams in `apps/v1/public/figures` and reference them with root-relative paths, for example `![Diagram](/figures/architecture.png)`. The site deploy pipeline automatically fingerprints and serves them.
- **Linking tips**
  - Prefer relative links such as `[JSON schema](./json-schema)`; Fumadocs resolves them automatically (`apps/v1/src/app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` wires this up via `createRelativeLink`).
  - External links should include `https://` and will open in a new tab by default.
- **Preview options**
  - If you are comfortable running commands: `pnpm dev --filter v1`, then open `http://localhost:3000/docs`.
  - Otherwise, edit the MDX file on GitHub, create a pull request, and use the autogenerated Vercel preview link to review the rendered page before merging.
- **Publishing checklist**
  - Confirm the page title and description are populated.
  - Scan the sidebar to be sure the new page is listed once.
  - Check that any code blocks declare their language (`bash, `ts) for syntax highlighting.
  - Ask an engineer to merge once the preview looks good; deployments are automated via the main branch.
